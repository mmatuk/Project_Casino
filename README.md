# Project_Casino

The goal of this project is to create a working Casio application mostly in Java. 

The Casio will only have a working roulette game, but more will be added once the overall design is finished. The user will be able to sign in and out. The user can withdraw money from the bank (not real money, the game is only for fun) and try to increase their winnings. Multiple tables of different betting maximums and minims will give the opportunity to pick the best place to play and win.

The roulette game is made from scratch using only java GUI components in all code.

Future version will contain more games and a redesigned layout.
